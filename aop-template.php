            <h3>How Is Square Footage Calculated?</h3>
            <p>Square footage calculations shown on our website include only
              living (heated/cooled) spaces and are calculated from the outside
              perimeter of the exterior walls. They do not include decks, porches,
              garages, basements, attics, fireplaces, etc. and the non-heated
              spaces in the house will be listed separately on the plan detail
              page. Two story, vaulted areas and staircases are only included
              once in the first floor area. Brick is not counted in our square
              footage calculations.</p>
